# CIShell

This is the core of the CIShell framework, see http://cishell.org/

A warning: this framework is surprisingly big, mainly because of the
release engineering components in deployment/.  You can expect about
1.5 GB of disk usage from the git repository and the working tree.

For build instructions, see [the instructions for building Sci2](https://github.com/cns-iu/cishell-applications/blob/master/README.md).

** Edit May 30 2018 **
This repo contains CIShell's GUI.
To run CIShell, checkout and build cishell-core.
Then checkout and build cishell-ref-gui.
